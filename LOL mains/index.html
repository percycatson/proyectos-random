            <p class="card-text">Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to prove he was a hero
                by slaying a fearsome monster—only to discover that the beast, a lonely and magical yeti,
                merely needed a friend.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Janna</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Armed with the power of Runeterra's gales, Janna is a mysterious,
                elemental wind spirit who protects the dispossessed of Zaun. Some believe she was
                brought into existence by the pleas of Runeterra's sailors who prayed for fair winds
                 as they navigated.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Innately connected to the magic of the spirit realm, Ahri is a fox-like
                 vastaya who can manipulate her prey's emotions and consume their essence—receiving flashes
                 of their memory and insight from each soul she consumes.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Hailing from a long lost tribe of vastaya, Neeko can blend into any crowd by
                borrowing the appearances of others, even absorbing something of their emotional state to tell
                friend from foe in an instant. No one is ever sure where—or who—Neeko might be.</p>
